# hive-sql

This extension provides Hive SQL support for VSCode. It also provides some basic code snippets for operations such as creating a table, altering a table, or renaming columns.

The language specification is from the [hive-sublime-text](https://github.com/glinmac/hive-sublime-text) project, with slight modifications by me.

## Features

Enables syntax highlighting and formatting for Hive SQL, including user-defined functions.

**To enable the extension on your file, either name the file with a extension:**

**.hql**

**.ql**

**.q**

**Or press F1, type 'Change Language Mode', and then choose HiveSQL.**
